Pocket Amp:
Summon an Amplifier on to the field. Whenever you play "Bardsongs", they will be played through the Amp as well.

Soothing Sounds:
Bardsong: Heal allies near you. The closer you are to an ally, the more they are healed

Crowd-Surfer:
Target an ally. Dash in a straight line, stopping next to them.

Power Chord:
Bardsong: Play a hella chord that grants healing and buffs to allies, and debuffs enemies. The closer they are, the more potent the effects.

Slide Guitar!:
Slide X tiles in a straight line. When the slide ends, play a chord that heals allies and hurts enemies. The closer they are, the more potent the effects.

Shrieker
Bardsong: Use your guitar and Amplifier to cause an undescribably horrible sound that damages enemies and enrages allies, causing them to do more damage.
The close you are to your Amplifier, and everyone else is to you, the more potent the effects.

Improv Session:
Bardsong: Jam out and grant allies random positive effects, and enemies random negative effects. The closer they are, the more potent the effects.

Rift Riffs:
Play some riffs, opening up rifts between you and an enemy or ally that anyone can use to teleport between the two.
